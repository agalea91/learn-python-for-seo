# Learn Python for SEO

Python tutorials for beginners with focus on SEO applications.

First, you'll want to have Python installed. For the smoothest expeience with these tutorials I recommend getting [the Anaconda distribtion of Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

To work through the tutorials as they were intended, get started by downloading this repository. You can [download the folder in zip format](https://github.com/agalea91/learn-python-for-seo/archive/master.zip) or clone it with git:

`git clone https://github.com/agalea91/learn-python-for-seo/archive/master.zip`

Since you will be generating the content in `learn-python-for-seo/output`, make sure that folder is empty.

To open the `.ipynb` files you have to open them in the ipython notebook interface. This can be done by opening a terminal and then typing `jupyter notebook` and navigating to the `learn-python-for-seo` folder. 

Finally, after opening a tutorial notebook, make sure to clear the code outputs before working through. This can be done by clicking `Cell -> All Output -> Clear` in the toolbar menu at the top.
