    "All programming languages are designed to be a higher-level abstraction for doing binary operations inside your computer. Some of the first popular languages like Fortran and C were (not so long ago) considered to be high-level, but newer and increasingly more abstract languages such as Python and R have taken that title and relegated these to have low-level status.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how Python fits in among the other languages, it's important to understand that each was created with certain desired applications and user-experience considerations in mind. Often balancing these things is a tradeoff. For example, Python is very user friendly but not as fast as C or C++.  Going from old to new (roughly speaking and ignoring tons of popular languages) the paying field looks something like this:\n",
    " - __Fortran__: very fast and built for numerical computing, still used heavily in the scientific community\n",
    " - __C__: allows for more control over memory than Fortran (pointers), which can be exploited by hackers\n",
    " - __C++__: adding classes to C to enable object-oriented programming\n",
    " - __Java__: higher level (more user friendly) than C++ with similar syntax, programs run the same on any machine\n",
    " - __R__: high level functional language build for statistical data analysis\n",
    " - __Python__: high level functional and object oriented language, built to be multipurpose and extensible through external libraries"
